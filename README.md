database-tools
==============

Tools to query the OpenTaal database

In order to run these database tools, make sure to have to following two files with appropriate one word text in them:
- ../.database-username
- ../.database-password

Use only the Bash scripts .sh. These will call when needed the Pyhton scripts .py.

Note that all files .tmp, .txt, .csv and .tsv are ignored by the source repository since they can be regenerated at any time.
